## Data Base
This project uses the H2 in-memory database for simplicity and ease of testing.
To persist data between application restarts, an H2 database file is included in the root directory.
This ensures that sample or test data is not lost when the application is restarted.
Keeping the H2 file allows you to retain test data without requiring a full database setup.

H2 Console can be accessed at:
```
http://localhost:8090/h2-console
```
## Swagger access
To access swagger use the following url to list and test all end points:

```
